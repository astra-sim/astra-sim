# ASTRA-sim
[ASTRA-sim](https://astra-sim.github.io/) is a distributed AI system simulator. It models the end-to-end software and hardware stack of modern AI systems - encompassing workload scheduling, collective communication algorithms, and hardware architectures (compute/memory/network). Through a suite of APIs, it enables plug-and-play of external open/proprietary components for modeling different parts of the AI system. This provides end-to-end multi-fidelity simulation capabilities for aiding in design and deployment of next-generation distributed AI systems.
