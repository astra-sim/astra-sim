*  **scheduling-policy**: (LIFO/FIFO) 
	* The order we proritize collectives according based on their time of arrival.
        LIFO means that most recently created collectives have higher priority. While
	FIFO is the reverse.
*  **intra-dimension-scheduling**: (FIFO/SCF)
	* The order we proritize collective chunks inside each dimension. 
	FIFO means that the least recently created collectives have higher priority.
	SCF means that the smallest chunk have higher priority.
*  **inter-dimension-scheduling**: (baseline/themis)
	* The order we proritize collective chunks across multiple dimensions.
	baseline means that the scheduling always uses a constant schedule for all chunks.
	themis means that the scheduling issues chunks to the dimension with least load.
*   **endpoint-delay**: (int)
	* The time NPU spends processing a message after receiving it in terms of cycles.
*  **active-chunks-per-dimension:**: (int)
	* This corresponds to the Maximum number of chunks we like execute in parallel on
	each logical dimesnion of topology.
*  **preferred-dataset-splits**: (int)
	* The number of chunks we divide each collective into.
* **all-reduce-implementation:**: (Dimension0Collective_Dimension1Collective_...\_DimensionNCollective)
	* Here we can create a multiphase colective all-reduce algorithm and directly specify
	the collective algorithm type for each logical dimension. The available options (algorithms) are:
	ring, direct, doubleBinaryTree, oneRing, oneDirect.
	For example, "ring_doubleBinaryTree" means we create a 
	logical topology with 2 dimensions and we perform ring algorithm
	on the first dimension followed by double binary tree on the second
	dimension for the all-reduce pattern. Hence the number of physical dimension should be
	equal to the number of logical dimensions. The only exceptions are oneRing/oneDirect
	where we assume no matter how many physical dimensions we have, we create a one big logical
	ring/direct(AllToAll) topology where all NPUs are connected and perfrom a one phase ring/direct algorithm.
	Note that oneRing and oneDirect is not available for Garnet Backend in this version. 
* **reduce-scatter-implementation:**: (Dimension0CollectiveAlg_Dimension1CollectiveAlg_...\_DimensionNCollectiveAlg)
	* The same as "all-reduce-implementation:" but for reduce-scatter collective. 
	The available options are: ring, direct, oneRing, oneDirect.
* **all-gather-implementation:**: (Dimension0CollectiveAlg_Dimension1CollectiveAlg_...\_DimensionNCollectiveAlg)
	* The same as "all-reduce-implementation:" but for all-gather collective. 
	The available options (algorithms) are: ring, direct, oneRing, oneDirect.
* **all-to-all-implementation:**: (Dimension0CollectiveAlg_Dimension1CollectiveAlg_...\_DimensionNCollectiveAlg)
	* The same as "all-reduce-implementation:" but for all-to-all collective. 
	The available options (algorithms) are: ring, direct, oneRing, oneDirect.  
* **collective-optimization**: (baseline/localBWAware)
	* baseline issues allreduce across all dimensions to handle
	allreduce of single chunk. While for an N-dimensional network, localBWAware issues a series of
	reduce-scatters on all dimensions from dim1 to dimN-1, followed by all-reduce on dimN, and then
	series of all-gathers starting from dimN-1 to dim1. This optimization is used to reduce the
	chunk size as it goes to the next network dimensions.
	
*NOTE: The default clock cycle period is 1ns (1 Ghz feq). This value is defined inside Sys.hh.
One can change it to any number. It will be a configurable command line parameter in the later
versions.*
